# Diamond Bot Commands

This is a list of public commands you can add to the bot. If you have an idea for a command feel free to open an issue or a pull request and I will gladly review it as soon as I can.

All commands are in separate packages and have to be installed one by one, also they have their own readme detailing what they do, how they are used, and in the case they need it, how to configure them.
